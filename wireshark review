8	127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	TCP	ACK, Ack=5, Len=0

Analysis:
This is a loopback communication where the system is sending and receiving packets to itself (127.0.0.1).

All packets use TCP protocol between ports 50725 and 50726.

The presence of [PSH, ACK] and small payload lengths (1 byte) indicate a likely test or debugging transmission, possibly generated by a local script, application, or service.

The alternating pattern of [PSH, ACK] followed by [ACK] indicates normal TCP communication with acknowledgment.

Technical Highlights:
IP Version: IPv4

Source/Destination: Same (localhost)

Data Payload: 1 byte per [PSH, ACK] packet

No retransmissions or packet loss detected

Conclusion:
The capture file shows a clean, successful TCP exchange over the loopback interface, commonly used for local testing and development. No anomalies, errors, or dropped packets were observed.
