Report on Kaspersky Password Checker Screenshot

Website: https://password.kaspersky.com/

Main Purpose: To help users check the strength of their passwords and encourage the creation of more secure ones.



User Input Analysis

The user entered: deekSHI007@gmail.com

The tool analyzed it as a password, not just an email.

The result shows: "Your password is strong"




Password Strength Criteria Passed:

The password/email input met all the following conditions:

Contains digits
Contains special symbols
Contains capital letters
No common text patterns
Not found in any leaked password databases


Educational Section on the Page:

Explains password brute-forcing: Trying all combinations until a correct match is found.

Emphasizes the importance of avoiding weak/common passwords like "qwerty" or "123456".


Observations:

Although the input resembles an email address, the tool still evaluated it as a password.

The analysis assumes the string is a password, not validating the context of the input.



Recommendation:

Never enter your actual password or personal email-password combinations on online tools, even trustworthy ones. For testing, use variations or sample passwords.
